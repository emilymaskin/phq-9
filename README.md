# phq-9
A prototype for the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, showing choices of doctors for a patient to choose depending on score

This project was my introduction to React.js. It features one main Questionnaire Class, with several other Classes to render sub components (Question, Choice, Doctor, Message).
